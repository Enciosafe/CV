      <p>
          Hey! I'm <span style={style}>Stanislav</span>, a beginner and motivated fullstack developer. It took me a long time to get to this profession, from my early inclination to the world of high technology to earning an engineering degree and systematic studying of English in the course of my work.
          Each case that I have been involved in has always brought good results, and building material for my personality formation, my skills and aspirations. I can find a common language with a variety of people, work for a result, find my place in the team and bring something of my own into the common work.
          New "features" every single day is my lifestyle. The highest praise for me is to be a person let people consider as a professional who can be entrusted with any task. Healthy ambitions and concrete, non-abstract goals are direct evidence of mental alertness and energy. Let's get things done together!</p>
