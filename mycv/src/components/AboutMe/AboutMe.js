      <p>
          Hey! I'm <span style={style}>Stanislav</span>, a beginner and motivated fullstack developer. I walked for a long time to this profession, from my early love for the world of high technology, to getting an engineering education and systematic study of the English language in the course of my work.
          Each of the cases that I have been involved in has always brought good results, and, as a result, has become a building material for the formation of me, my skills and aspirations. I can find a common language with a variety of people, work for a result, find my place in the team and bring something of my own into the common work.
          Learning something new is my style of life, and being a person about whom they say that he is a professional, and he can be entrusted with any task is the highest praise. Healthy ambitions and concrete, non-abstract goals are direct evidence of mental alertness and energy. Let's get things done together!</p>
